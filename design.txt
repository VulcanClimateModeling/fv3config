Making directories
modifying directories
loading config from yaml
overturning restart folders

With restart data we need to:
- save the data to a run directory
    - ensure that the IO layout is consistent with the saved restart data 
- the input restart data may come with multiple files per tile, the output may require one file per tile or some different number of files per tile

Create a run directory from scratch
- optional source of restart data
- optional namelist parameters
- forcing data source

Move restart data to input directory

A way to access configuration from python

DiagTable specifies what diagnostic outputs you want
- has an experiment name, used as "title" value in netcdf output
- start date of model run
    Always use the start date in the namelist, there's a parameter for this
Want to specify DiagTable to use through an option name (we decide and make the options) or filename
DiagTable name would be a ConfigOption

StateData
    Input data/restart data
RunDirectory
    FieldTable depends on microphysics option
    DiagTable depends on what option name or file name is selected
    DataTable is an empty file which... I guess needs to exist?
Config
    - When a value is set, check if that value is a NamelistOption and if it is, update that NamelistOption
    owns a NamelistFile
    - dump to and load from a yaml file
ConfigOption
    subclass NamelistOption
    subclass DiagTableOption


NamelistFile
    - load and save configuration options
Namelist
    - load and save configuration options
    - Has a set of NamelistOption
NamelistOption
    - name
    - default
    - description
    - internal=False

ForcingData
    We want to symlink these
    Includes grb files which are placed in a location defined in namelist
        we'll set default values that just point to run directory
    Includes files in root run directory
    Includes *one* file for ozone forcing that goes in INPUT/


Create a RunDirectory given a RestartData (optional), ForcingData, and Config.
Create a RunDirectory from an existing folder.
Modify Config of a RunDirectory
All operations lazy, then have Apply method
Apply RestartData to a folder on disk given a Config containing IO configuration
Apply Config to NamelistFiles on disk.

Central NamelistFile list that says what the defaults are and what namelists exist.
Other packages need to be able to add configuration options
Other packages need to be able to convert NamelistOption's to `internal`.
